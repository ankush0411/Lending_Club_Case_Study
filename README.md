## General Information
### Project Information
The project is a data science project that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not and find out the factors that might result in defaulted.

### Problem Statement

Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:

Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
* **Fully paid**: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
* **Current**: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
* **Charged-off**: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 

In other words, **borrowers** who **default** cause the largest amount of **loss to the lenders**. In this case, the customers labelled as *'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'*.

The core objective of the excercise is to **help the company minimise the credit loss**. There are two potential sources of **credit loss** are:
* Applicant **likely to repay the loan**, such an applicant will bring in profit to the company with interest rates.** Rejecting such applicants will result in loss of business**.
* Applicant **not likely to repay** the loan, i.e. and will potentially default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss* for the company

In this we are using csv dataset:-
- **loan.csv**
